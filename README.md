# CourseraCNN

These are the ipython notebook files for the projects I worked on during
deeplearning.ai's course on Convolutional Neural Networks. The projects here
include:
- A face recognizer and identifier
- A car detector and localizer using YOLOv2
- A ResNet
- A CNN built in numpy <br />
And more. <br />

Note: if you would like to view these ipython notebooks online, you can
copy the URL to the notebook and go to the following website:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org <br />
and paste the URL to the notebook there, where it will open and display it.
